Setting Up the Python Environment
Required Libraries
To run the script successfully, the other person will need to have the following libraries installed:

rembg: This library is used to remove the background from images.
easygui: This library provides a simple interface for file selection dialogs.
PIL (Pillow): This library is used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
You can list these dependencies in a requirements.txt file, which makes it easy for others to install them using pip.

Create a requirements.txt file in your project directory with the following content:

plaintext
Copy code
rembg
easygui
Pillow
Setting Up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your project. Here's how to set up a virtual environment in Python using VSCode:

Open VSCode and navigate to your project directory.
Open a Terminal within VSCode:
Use the shortcut `Ctrl + `` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal.
Create a Virtual Environment:
Run the following command to create a virtual environment named venv:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment:
On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install Required Libraries:
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the libraries listed in requirements.txt using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Using the Python Script
Running the Script
Place your script (let's call it background_removal.py) in the project directory.
Run the Script:
Ensure that the virtual environment is activated.
Execute the script using:
bash
Copy code
python background_removal.py
Follow the Prompts:
The script will prompt the user to select an input image and specify where to save the processed image.
README.md File
Create a README.md file in your project directory and include the following content:
